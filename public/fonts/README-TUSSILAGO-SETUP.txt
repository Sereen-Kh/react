INSTRUCTIONS FOR TUSSILAGO FONT SETUP

1. Obtain Tussilago font files from your brand guidelines/font license
2. Convert to web formats if needed:
   - WOFF2 (primary, smaller file size)
   - WOFF (fallback for older browsers)

3. Name your files as follows and place in public/fonts/:
   - Tussilago-Regular.woff2
   - Tussilago-Regular.woff  
   - Tussilago-Bold.woff2
   - Tussilago-Bold.woff

4. If you have different font weights (Light, Medium, etc.), update src/index.css
   with additional @font-face declarations

5. Test by running: npm run dev
   - Headlines should display in Tussilago
   - Paragraphs should display in Roboto
   - If Tussilago files are missing, Georgia will be used as fallback
